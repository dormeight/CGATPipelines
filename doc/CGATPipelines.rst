==================
Inactive pipelines
==================

The pipelines are currently not being actively used. This might be
because they have evolved into different pipelines. For example,
pipeline_chipseq is now split into pipeline_mapping,
pipeline_peakcalling and pipeline_intervals. In other cases, pipelines
have addressed a specific issue but have not been reused since.

The pipelines are listed below for completeness:
