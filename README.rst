==================
The CGAT pipelines
==================

The CGAT_ pipelines package contains a set of ruffus_ based pipelines to
run workflows in comparative genomics or and NGS analysis.

We are currently in the process of building this package, please come
back and visit soon.
 
For questions, please subscribe and contact us at the 
`CGAT user group
<https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/cgat-user-group>`_.

Documentation of CGAT tools is available 
`here <http://www.cgat.org/downloads/public/cgatpipelines/documentation>`_.

Note that we currently are not able to fully support and document the 
pipelines. They are under continuous development and changing rapidly.
However, they might give some ideas or building blocks when developing
your own pipelines.
